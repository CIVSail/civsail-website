# CLAUDE.md – CIVSail Project Context, Vision & Engineering Standards

> **Read this first.** This document gives Claude Code (or any AI assistant) complete context on CIVSail: what it is, why it exists, how to think about it, and the technical standards to follow.

---

## 🤖 How an LLM Should Behave in This Repo

When assisting with CIVSail, follow these principles:

| Principle | What It Means in Practice |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Favor clarity over cleverness** |
| **Prefer modular, documented solutions** | features should be extractable. functions should explain its purpose. |
| **Assume domain-expert but engineering-novice** | Alec knows maritime careers deeply but is learning to code. Explain technical concepts; don't explain what a TWIC card is. |
| **Optimize for long-term maintainability** | This platform will grow for years. Write code that future-Alec (or future-contributors) can extend without rewriting. |
| **Align with mariner autonomy and neutrality** | CIVSail empowers individuals to make their own choices. Never build features that manipulate, coerce, or favor one employer/union over another. |

### Specific Guidance

**When proposing solutions:**
- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Offer 2-3 options when tradeoffs exist (with clear pros/cons)
- Default to simpler approaches; only add complexity when justified
- Flag any security, privacy, or neutrality concerns immediately

**When writing code:**
- Comments explain business logic and maritime context, not syntax
- Error messages should help users fix problems, not blame them
- UI copy should be respectful of mariner intelligence and autonomy

**When in doubt:**
- Ask clarifying questions rather than assume
- Err on the side of user privacy and data minimization
- Remember: this platform serves individuals

---

## 🎯 What CIVSail Is

**CIVSail.com** is a modern, mariner-first software and information platform designed to support U.S. merchant mariners across their entire career lifecycle.

**Initial Focus:** MSC CIVMARs (Military Sealift Command civilian mariners)
**Expanding To:** All U.S. mariners (commercial, NOAA, tugs, offshore, yachts)

### What CIVSail Is NOT

| CIVSail is NOT... | Because... |
|-------------------|------------|
| A recruiting tool | We don't steer people toward specific employers |
| A union tool | We don't advocate for or against organized labor |
| An employer sales channel | We don't sell mariner data or attention to companies |
| A government mouthpiece | We present facts, not propaganda |

### What CIVSail IS

**A neutral career infrastructure layer** that helps individuals:

- **Understand their options** – Career paths, credential requirements, pay structures, lifestyle tradeoffs
- **Reduce friction** – Automate paperwork, track credentials, simplify bureaucracy
- **Make informed decisions** – Data and tools, not sales pitches
- **Maintain leverage and autonomy** – Knowledge is power; CIVSail democratizes industry knowledge

> **CIVSail serves individuals first.** Employers, unions, agencies, and institutions benefit indirectly through better-prepared, better-matched mariners – but they are never the primary customer.

---

## 🧭 Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Choice Architecture, Not Persuasion

CIVSail does not "sell" career paths. It lays out tradeoffs clearly and lets the individual decide.

```
❌ WRONG: "MSC is the best choice for new mariners!"
✅ RIGHT: "Here's how MSC compares to commercial shipping on pay,
          time home, credential requirements, and job security.
          Your priorities determine the best fit."
```

### 2. People Are Built to Work Hard, Not Navigate Complexity

Mariners are capable, hardworking professionals. They shouldn't need to be bureaucracy experts to manage their careers.

**CIVSail absorbs complexity so users can focus on execution.**

- Credential tracking – automated, not manual spreadsheets
- Pay calculations – instant, not "ask around"
- Career planning – structured, not tribal knowledge

### 3. Career Governance Over Job Placement

CIVSail is not a job board. It's a **career governance platform**.

| Job Board | Career Governance |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Here's a job opening" | "Here's where you are in your career" |
| Transactional | Long-term relationship |
| Employer-driven | Mariner-driven |
| Reactive | Proactive |

Mariners are responsible for their careers. CIVSail provides structure, visibility, and tooling.

### 4. Modular, Composable, Future-Proof

Every feature is built as an independent module that can:
- Scale independently
- Recombine with other features
- Potentially be sold or licensed separately
- Be maintained without breaking other features

```typescript
// GOOD: Modular design
// /lib/credentials/       – Credential tracking module
// /lib/pay-calculator/    – Pay calculation module
// /lib/career-paths/      – Career mapping module
// Each can evolve independently

// BAD: Monolithic design
// /lib/everything.ts      – One giant file that does it all
```

**Purpose:** Make implicit industry knowledge explicit and navigable.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Career Path Explorer** | Visual maps of career progression across MSC, commercial, NOAA, tugs, offshore, yachts, shore-side |
| **Tradeoff Analysis** | Compare paths on: pay, time home, lifestyle, credential burden, job security, advancement speed |
| **Audience-Specific Views** | Tailored for: prospective mariners, parents, guidance counselors, mid-career mariners planning exits/pivots |
| **Credential Roadmaps** | "To get from AB to Chief Mate, you need X sea time, Y courses, Z endorsements" |

### Strategic Expansion (Planned)

#### Career Governance Layer
A persistent career "control panel" including:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sea Time Tracking** | Log by year, vessel, employer – exportable for license applications |
| **Credential Progress** | Visual progress toward next upgrade (e.g., "127 of 360 days toward Chief Mate") |
| **Education Planning** | schedules at various maritime schools, maritime academy pathways, grad school timing, where and when to take other classes, one click preparation |

#### Retention & Workforce Intelligence
Aggregated, **non-PII** insights for the industry:

| Insight | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Attrition Risk Indicators** | Help institutions understand why mariners leave (without identifying individuals) |
| **Credential Bottlenecks** | Identify where the licensing pipeline is broken and where and when people change companies|
| **Sea Time Gaps** | Understand workforce availability patterns |
** help mariners get placed in positions most fitting for them.

> **Privacy Principle:** Individual data is private. Aggregate insights help the industry without compromising anyone's autonomy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 14 (App Router) | Server components by default, `'use client'` only for interactivity |
| **Language** | TypeScript (strict mode) | All files `.ts`/`.tsx` – no `any` types allowed |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, no separate CSS files |
| **Components** | shadcn/ui + Lucide icons | Use when they simplify; don't over-engineer |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Auth, DB, Storage – RLS enabled on ALL tables |
| **Maps** | Mapbox GL JS | Satellite imagery for port pages |
| **PDF** | pdf-lib | Client-side generation (no server costs) |
| **Validation** | Zod | Runtime validation for all user inputs |
| **APIs** | Gmail, OpenWeather, DVIDS | See integrations section |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Auto-deploy from `main` branch |

**Developer:** Alec (intermediate beginner in web development – domain expert in maritime careers)

**Project Root:** `~/dev/civsail-fresh`

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Build for the Future

This codebase is **infrastructure**, not a throwaway project:

1. **Data Pipeline Ready** – Structure data to support future analytics, ETL, real-time features, mobile apps
2. **Modular Design** – Every feature extractable into its own module
3. **API-First** – All data through API routes (enables future mobile app, third-party integrations)
4. **Event-Driven Hooks** – Analytics/tracking hooks ready (connect later to PostHog, Mixpanel, etc.)

### Code Quality Priorities (in order)

1. **Security** – Never compromise on auth, validation, secrets, privacy
2. **Correctness** – Code does what it claims
3. **Readability** – Future developers can understand it (including future-Alec)
4. **Performance** – Fast for users on ship WiFi
5. **Features** – Only after the above are satisfied

---

## 🔒 Security Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// ALWAYS check auth in protected API routes
import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const supabase = createServerClient();
  const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

  if (!user) {
    return Response.json(
      { ok: false, error: { code: 'UNAUTHORIZED', message: 'Please log in' } },
      { status: 401 }
    );
  }
  // Proceed with authenticated user...
}
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
// ALWAYS validate inputs with Zod
import { z } from 'zod';

const ProfileSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string().min(1).max(100).trim(),
  lastName: z.string().min(1).max(100).trim(),
  refNumber: z.string().regex(/^\d{7}$/, 'Must be 7-digit NMC reference'),
});

const parsed = ProfileSchema.safeParse(body);
if (!parsed.success) {
  return Response.json(
    { ok: false, error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: parsed.error.issues } },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### Secrets Management
```typescript
// ✅ Server-side only (no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
const apiKey = process.env.DVIDS_API_KEY;

// ❌ NEVER expose secrets to client
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_KEY; // WRONG!
```

### Security Checklist (Every Feature)
- [ ] Auth check on protected routes
- [ ] Input validation with Zod
- [ ] RLS policies on new tables
- [ ] No secrets in client code
- [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints
- [ ] Privacy-preserving by default

---

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### File Headers
```typescript
/**
 * @file PayCalculator.tsx
 * @description Calculate and compare mariner pay across ship classes
 *
 * @purpose Help mariners make informed decisions about ship assignments
 *          by showing real earnings potential, not just base wages.
 *
 * @example
 * <PayCalculator shipClass="t-ake" daysDeployed={120} />
 */
```

### Function Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate total annual earnings for a mariner on a specific ship class
 *
 * Includes: base wage, overtime, premium pay, retention bonus, benefits value
 * Does NOT include: per diem (variable), travel reimbursement
 *
 * @param shipClass - The ship class (e.g., 't-ake', 't-ao')
 * @param position - Mariner's position (e.g., 'AB', 'OS', '3M')
 * @param daysDeployed - Expected deployment days per year
 * @returns Estimated annual earnings breakdown
 *
 * @note Wages based on 2024 MEBA/SIU contracts; update annually
 */
```

### Comments – Explain WHY and Maritime Context
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: States the obvious
const isExpired = date < today; // Check if expired

// ✅ GOOD: Explains business logic
// NMC allows a 1-year grace period for renewal, but most employers
// won't let you sail with expired credentials. We warn at 90 days
// to give mariners time to schedule the physical and paperwork.
const isExpiringSoon = daysBetween(today, date) <= 90;
```

### TODO Format
```typescript
// TODO(alec): Add loading skeleton
// TODO(security): Rate limit before launch
// TODO(career-paths): Integrate with credential roadmap
// FIXME: Breaks when ship name has apostrophe (O'Brien)
```

## ⚡ Performance Standards

### Targets (Ship WiFi is Slow!)
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP | < 2.5s |
| FID | < 100ms |
| CLS | < 0.1 |

### Patterns
```typescript
// Use Next.js Image
import Image from 'next/image';
<Image src="/hero.jpg" width={1200} height={600} priority alt="..." />

// Lazy load heavy components
const MapboxMap = dynamic(() => import('@/components/MapboxMap'), {
  loading: () => <div className="h-96 bg-gray-200 animate-pulse" />,
  ssr: false,
});

// Select only needed columns
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('first_name, last_name') // Not select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId);
```

---

## 📊 Data & Analytics Foundation

### Event Tracking (Ready for Analytics)
```typescript
// lib/analytics.ts
type EventName =
  | 'page_view'
  | 'tool_used'
  | 'credential_verified'
  | 'career_path_explored'
  | 'pay_calculated'
  | 'port_guide_viewed';

export function trackEvent(name: EventName, properties?: Record<string, unknown>) {
  // TODO: Connect to PostHog/Mixpanel
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log('[Analytics]', name, properties);
  }
}
```

### Privacy Principles
- Individual data is **private by default**
- Aggregate insights only (non-PII)
- Users can export their own data (GDPR-ready)
- No selling user data or attention

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Consistent Response Format
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  ok: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string; // User-friendly
  };
}
```

### User-Friendly Messages
```typescript
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  'UNAUTHORIZED': 'Please log in to continue.',
  'NOT_FOUND': "We couldn't find what you're looking for.",
  'VALIDATION_ERROR': 'Please check your input and try again.',
  'INTERNAL_ERROR': 'Something went wrong. Please try again.',
};
```
