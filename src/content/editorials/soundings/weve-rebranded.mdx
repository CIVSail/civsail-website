## CIVMAR.com is now CIVSail.com

Let me just start by saying this:

**The Navy's lawyers respond WAY faster than your detailer.**

Honestly, if N12 operated with the same urgency as the Trademark Office, this site might not even need to exist.

Recently, I received an official cease and desist from Navy legal counsel regarding the use of the term "CIVMAR" in my domain name, along with ship names and designations on apparel.

Fair enough — it stung a bit. But it also reminded me of a quote from everyone's favorite maritime rogue:

> "You are without a doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of."
> "But you have heard of me." — Jack Sparrow

What started as a rinky-dink site built to help mariners with the basics — travel claims, leave chits and easily accessible forms — has slowly been gaining traction and attention.

For better or worse.

If you've used a tool, sent a message, or shared the site with a fellow mariner: thank you. Seriously. I see the website traffic, and I see the need. This rebrand may be sooner than anticipated, but it also means we're onto something.

## Why the Change?

Yes, it's frustrating. But in truth, this rebrand was already in the works.

The site was never meant to serve just Military Sealift Command mariners. While CIVMARs were the starting point (and yes, I've sailed with you and understand the specific struggles), the goal has always been broader.

Mariners from all walks — NOAA, CONMAR, commercial deep sea, tugboats, OSVs, and even cadets — face similar challenges:

- Poor communication
- Confusing paperwork
- Lack of transparency
- Limited resources

Despite the critical role we play in keeping global commerce and defense afloat, mariners often feel like an afterthought. That's where CIVSail comes in.

## What is CIVSail?

CIVSail is designed to help you to, through, and after your sailing career.

Whether you're applying for your first MMC, choosing between MSC and a tug company, or planning for a career ashore, we want to give you the tools, resources, and community to succeed.

We're still in the early stages, but we are building toward a more modern, mariner-focused digital hub. We have a lot in the works.

## Want to Help?

If you believe something like this should exist, you can support the mission directly. We just dropped a limited run of "More Sh!t Coming" merch.

Given the situation, it feels fitting — and unlike your ship store's mismatch of leftover extra-smalls and 4XLs, these will actually fit you, too.

Thanks again for all the support — the site is seeing steady traffic, and I'm grateful to everyone who's used a tool, shared a post, or sent feedback.

We're not done yet.

**There is More Sh!t Coming.**

Safe Sailing,
