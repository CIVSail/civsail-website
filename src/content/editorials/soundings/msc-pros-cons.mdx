Are you curious about what working for Military Sealift Command (MSC) is really like? From the thrills of open seas and foreign ports to the frustrations of office bureaucracy, we're diving deep into the pros and cons of life as a MSC CIVMAR (Civilian Mariner). Whether you're pondering a career change, looking for excitement or are simply intrigued by what happens behind the scenes of global maritime operations, continue reading to see what those weird grey ships are all about.

## Pro 1: Earn More Money with Room to Climb

You can pocket some serious cash working for MSC. Entry-level positions like Supply Utility, Wiper or Ordinary Seaman, can make over $70,000 per year! No college degree is required, and you can join right out of high school! To put it in perspective, the average salary in the United States sits at around $59,000 per year. Entry level MSC CIVMARs earn a solid $10,000 more per year than the average American employee! To make things even better, expenses like food and rent are irrelevant which will allow you to save what you make!

Now, here's where it gets exciting: MSC has a clear trajectory for career growth. As you rack up the sea days and enhance your qualifications, your earnings will jump even higher. MSC is one of the last few companies where you can start at the bottom and climb to the very top. Many current Mariners began their careers in entry level positions and rose through the ranks to become Supply Officers, Chief Engineers and Captains. So, if you're looking for a career that pays an above average income with the ability to climb, MSC might be your ticket to a better tomorrow!

## Con 1: You Will be Gone A LOT

Life as a CIVMAR with Military Sealift Command (MSC) is anything but ordinary. When you sign up, you commit a minimum of 4 months, which amounts to a whopping 120 days, to each vessel you are assigned. You do get 30 calendar days of vacation in between assignments, but that still leaves you away from home, friends, and family for at least 8 months every year. While legislation to entitle CIVMARs 60 days of leave between assignments has been approved, it is unknown when it will be fully implemented.

Now here's the kicker: that calculation doesn't factor in the time spent in training, and it assumes that you'll always be relieved on time at the end of your assignment. But in reality, CIVMARs often find themselves overdue for relief and waiting their replacements, sometimes for weeks or even months past their scheduled relief dates.

Sure, the longer you stay on the ship, the more money you make. But there will come a point when money can't replace the time spent away from home and you are ready for a much-needed break. There are ways to secure extra time off between assignments and spend more time with your family, but it can be complex.

## Pro 2: Discovering Ports, Not Just Oceans

Now, let's talk about the biggest thing that sets Military Sealift Command (MSC) apart from other ships on the water. For commercial and union ships, it's all about hard work and spending as little time in port as possible. Commercial shipping companies see port visits as an expensive liability. The profit seeking companies earn their money when their ships are at sea moving cargo.

On the other hand, there's the Navy. Their job is to patrol the worlds ocean to ensure global maritime security. They aren't patrolling the ports. Heck, MSC exists so the Navy can stay at sea even longer without pulling into port!

Now, MSC? They're a different breed altogether. Many MSC ships pull into port for 2–4 days to reload their cargo and then they're back underway for 7-10 days to deliver that cargo to the Navy. Hell, some MSC ships are in port more than they are at sea! Unlike commercial vessels, MSC is run by the government, not a for profit company who rushes to leave port, so MSC CIVMARs get way more time to explore ports.

At the end of the MSC workday, you have the liberty to go explore the port you are in. What's more, MSC doesn't chain you down with the same strict liberty rules that the Navy enforces. As long as you show up for your next shift ready to roll, you're free to enjoy local restaurants, shops and the unique charms of the places you visit. And guess what? MSC even hooks you up with transportation from the ship to liberty hubs in the local area! With MSC, it's not just about sailing the seas; it's about exploring new places, one port at a time.

## Con 2: Navigating the Office Maze

If commercial companies are as smooth as a Chick-Fil-A drive-thru, MSC is a visit to the DMV. So, if you're expecting an operation that's sleek, well-organized and efficient, MSC might not be your cup of tea.

Like any big organization and especially the federal government, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. It's like wading through a maze of bureaucracy that makes you want to pull your hair out at every turn. Most folks in the office have never set foot on a ship and do not understand the unique challenges that CIVMARs face. To be honest though, it's not their job to understand. They have a lot of people to attend to and do not have the proper tools to properly manage the fleet. It's a losing game all around.

Even the simplest tasks, like extending leave, sorting out pay issues, or submitting paperwork, can be a real struggle. Things get especially frustrating when you're a month overdue on a ship, and all your email pleas to the office seem to vanish into thin air. MSC is a massive government agency with a crucial mission, and, well, sometimes you might feel like you're just another number on their spreadsheet — because you are.

The office's main concern is making sure Navy ships get what they need to complete their missions. The people in the office are frustrated with the system too. They would love it if their jobs were easier. So, when dealing with the office, it helps to keep that perspective in mind.

## Final Tip: MSC Isn't a Job, It's an Adventure

MSC is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Ships, ports, crews and missions come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. The sheer variety of experiences MSC offers is near infinite and MSC veterans have sea-stories for days.

Think about it this way: each class of MSC ships has its own mission, sails in a different corner of the world and carries a distinct crew. Your shipmates could become your best friends or your worst enemy. You might find yourself on an ESB soaking up the sun in Hawaii or on an AKE enduring the desert heat of Dubai. Some ships will spoil you with award-winning cuisine while others might offer hotdogs and beans at every meal. Sure, there are certain constants, like Taco Tuesdays and Burger Wednesdays, but every ship has its own character that sets it apart from the rest.

This diversity is a double-edged sword. A ship assignment could be the best of times or, well, the opposite. As you climb the ranks within the company, you'll start to figure out how each ship, fleet, and captain ticks. There's a saying within MSC that goes like this: "there are good ports, good people, and good money — pick one, because you're not getting all three."

Yes, ship assignments are a bit like rolling the dice since your assignments are based on the needs of the fleet, but there are ways to influence your ship choices and you can stay longer than the standard 4 months if you find a ship you really enjoy. Some folks stick around for years, while others complete their 4 months and run for the hills. This adventure is just another day at MSC.

## Conclusion: MSC is What You Make It

MSC is a unique journey that won't suit everyone. Like any profession, it comes with its share of ups and downs. Personally, I have had some of my most incredible days sailing with MSC — drinking beers in foreign ports with some buddies with money in the bank. These are experiences I could not have gotten anywhere else. However, it's no secret that working for MSC has also meant missing out on holidays, weddings, and birthdays that I can never reclaim. MSC is what you make of it. The key is to enjoy the highs and persevere through the lows while recognizing that luck and timing have a say too. So, if you're pondering a career with MSC or you're already a CIVMAR, don't sail into the unknown alone.
