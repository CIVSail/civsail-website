## What is Subsistence and Quarters?

Subsistence and Quarters, commonly referred to as **S&Q**, is an allowance, separate from your regular paycheck, that helps cover food and lodging expenses.

- **Subsistence (S)** is the money MSC provides for meals
- **Quarters (Q)** covers the cost of lodging

99% of the time, you will only receive the "S" portion of S&Q because MSC will almost always provide a hotel room. In most cases, you will receive **$38 per day** or **$266 per week** for the allowance.

> **Please note:** This payment, this $266 a week, is always referred to as S&Q despite only receiving the "S" part. It is just a commonly used and accepted term.

## Common Reasons to Receive S&Q

CIVMARs will most commonly receive S&Q when:

- In the pool waiting for a ship
- In training

There are very few other circumstances that allow CIVMARs to receive S&Q. **You do not receive S&Q on leave, nor when you are on a ship** where food and lodging is provided.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for S&Q, your home address must be **outside of the commuting radius**. CSU-E and CSU-W have different definitions of the commuting radius:

- **CSU-E (East Coast):** Defines it by neighborhood
- **CSU-W (West Coast):** Defines it by a 50-mile radius

If you're on the fringe, be prepared to plead your case. If you are unsure if your home address is within the East Coast commuting area, please see the attached NAVSTANORVAINST 4600.1 for additional details and a map.

## How Does It Work?

Each week you are in training or in the pool and eligible for S&Q, you will need to submit a new S&Q form.

**Ideally, you should submit your S&Q form on Monday morning each week** to give the contractors at the CIVMAR Support Units (abbreviated as CSU, which is the official name for the pools) time for processing. Once submitted and processed, you will receive your S&Q payment each week.

The East Coast Pool (CSU-E) and West Coast Pool (CSU-W) have different email addresses for S&Q processing. You need to submit your S&Q form to the coast you are physically located.

**For example:** If you are in training in San Diego, you submit your S&Q sheet to CSU-W. If you are checked into CSU-E to await a ship assignment, you submit your form to CSU-E.

### S&Q Email Addresses

**CSU-E (East Coast):** msc_civmar_sandq_east@us.navy.mil

**CSU-W (West Coast):** msc_civmar_sandq_west@us.navy.mil

## Payment Breakdown

Let's break down your daily subsistence allowance:

| Meal | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Breakfast | $6.00 |
| Lunch | $12.00 |
| Dinner | $20.00 |
| **Total Per Day** | **$38.00** |
| **Total Per Week** | **$266.00** |

If you are eligible for Quarters payment, you will receive an extra $40 per day to bring your weekly total to **$546**.

> **Remember:** You will probably never be eligible for the full $546, but you will be eligible for the $266 each week.

## Important Policies to Know

### Why is S&Q So Low?

The policy governing S&Q is **CMPI 593**. This instruction was written in 1992 and it hasn't been updated since. So, if you think the rate is a little low, that may be why.

Also, S&Q does not adjust with locality—you will receive the same rate in San Diego and Norfolk.

### Pending Disciplinary Action (PDA) and S&Q

If you are pending disciplinary action (PDA), you are eligible to receive S&Q if you report to a CSU. For more information and rules, please see Amendment to Human Resources Advisory 2011-08.

## Special Circumstances: When Would I Get the Full S&Q?

The main instance when CIVMARs are eligible for the full S&Q is when they are working in the office as a **Marine Placement Assistant** or a similar shoreside duty.

Even then, they will need to have an address outside the local commuting area to be eligible, and MSC will also offer for you to stay at a contract hotel. If you accept the full S&Q, note that you will be on your own to find a place to stay to complete your duties.

> **Please note:** These shoreside duties are exceedingly rare.
