## What is LER?

During NEO, you will receive a brief about Labor and Employee Relations (LER). LER is essentially union representation and the interplay between MSC, the maritime unions and CIVMARs.

## Understanding Labor Unions

Labor unions are organizations formed by workers to protect and advance their collective interests in the workplace. They negotiate with employers on behalf of their members to secure better wages, benefits and working conditions.

Additionally, unions provide support during disputes, advocate for fair treatment and offer representation in negotiations with management.

> **The purpose of a labor union is to empower workers and ensure they have a voice in decisions that affect their livelihoods.**

## Union Membership at MSC

As a Civilian Mariner (CIVMAR), while not mandatory, you have the option to join one of the three unions affiliated with MSC:

- **International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots (MMP)**
- **Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association (MEBA)**
- **Seafarers International Union (SIU)**

These 3 unions act as the exclusive representatives for employees within their respective units. The unions negotiate contracts and advocate for members' interests regarding grievances, personnel policies and working conditions as outlined in their collective bargaining agreements.

Pursers onboard ships maintain copies of the relevant agreements for review, and contacting a union representative is advised to understand your rights, benefits and responsibilities.

> There are many complex rules and regulations regarding union action. For a more complete picture of union representation with MSC and to decide if it is right for you to join a union, it is advisable to speak to a union representative. The union that you can join is dependent on your position and their union dues will vary.
