## What You Need to Understand

Training is a crucial aspect of a seagoing career. Proper training is paramount to advancement, and more importantly, the safe operation of the vessel. MSC offers hundreds of different training classes, with specific training requirements and career progressions for each rate.

Classes may be as simple as a Korea briefing, a 15 slide PowerPoint, or as complex as Refrigeration Engineer school that takes 6 weeks to complete. Navigating the various training opportunities at MSC can be confusing, but learning how to navigate the bureaucracy can help you advance in your career.

## Types of Training

Broadly speaking, there are mandatory trainings and advancement trainings. As the name implies, mandatory trainings are classes that CIVMARs are required to take to maintain minimal eligibility for shipboard assignment. On the other hand, advancement trainings are classes that help CIVMARs qualify for more advanced positions.

Additionally, other classes are "nice to haves". These "nice to have classes" look good on a KSA (resume) for promotion but are not necessarily mandatory for advancement.

### Mandatory Training and Classes

The foundation of basic maritime training is based on **"Standards of Training and Certificates of Watchkeeping"** commonly known as **"STCW"**. STCW requirements are worked into US policy and are the endorsements found in your Merchant Mariner Credential. These classes include Basic Safety Training (BST) and any other license or qualification you hold as regulated by the Coast Guard.

Additionally, MSC requires specific training in addition to the basic Coast Guard requirements. Classes such as:

- Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP)
- Survive Evade Resist Escape (SERE)
- Trafficking in Persons
- Cyber Awareness

These are not Coast Guard regulated classes, but internal to MSC. While these classes are required, they will not be noted in your MMC.

### Advancement Training and Classes

Advancement classes are not required to sail, but they are required if you want to promote.

**Deck or Engine Department:** To advance, you will need to take a mix of STCW (Coast Guard) classes and MSC specific classes to qualify for a higher position.

**Supply and Communication Departments:** These positions will only need to take MSC/Navy specific classes to be promoted. Supply and Communications positions are mostly unique to MSC (commercial companies do not have these billets), so they are not as regulated by the Coast Guard.

## Training Specialists

Each branch within MSC (Deck, Engine and Supply) have their own training specialists. Training Specialists are responsible for scheduling CIVMARs for approved classes and requesting training orders.

> If you have any specific questions about classes, training or schedules, your training specialist is a good place to start.

## How to Request Training

Regardless of where you are or what type of training you want to complete, you will need to complete a **"Training Request Form"**. A training request form requests basic information about the class, the dates and where you will be at the time of the class.

Once the form is completed, how you submit the form will vary depending on if you are currently on a ship or on leave.

### If You are on a Ship

To request training while on a ship, you need to go through your shipboard chain of command/department head. When on board, your department head will be the one to submit your request to the shoreside training specialists.

Before approving your request, your department head will need to take into consideration:

- The vessel's upcoming operational schedule
- Current manning level
- Whether they can afford to let you go
- Logistics of getting you to the training

**The most common time to request training while on board is just prior to your pay off date and/or just prior to a shipyard period.** It is uncommon for people to depart their vessels in the middle of a deployment for training due to the mission requirements and logistical difficulties.

### If You are on Leave or Not on a Ship

To request training while on leave or not on a ship, you will need to send a completed training request form via email to:

1. Your **Training Specialist**
2. Your **Marine Placement Specialist (MPS)**

Your Marine Placement Specialist (Detailer) will need to approve your training prior to the Training Specialist scheduling your class.

**Your probability of approval is very rate specific.** If there are many other people of your rate in the pool waiting for an assignment, they will likely approve it no problem. On the flip side, if you are the only person in the pool of your rate and there are overdue people and vacancies in the fleet, your training will more than likely be disapproved.

## Training Matrices

A training matrix is a chart that specifies all training requirements for positions onboard a particular class of ship. Training matrices for each class of ship can be found on the shipboard Safety Management System (SMS).

## Regulatory Bodies

Due to MSC's mix of civilian and Navy rules, MSC is governed/regulated by many different regulatory bodies that will require different types of training. These regulatory bodies include:

- The United States Coast Guard
- The United States Navy
- The United States Department of Defense
- The United States Federal Government
- Various International Regulatory Bodies
- Internal MSC policies

> **Important:** Your Merchant Mariner Credential, the document that legally allows you to be on a vessel, is issued by the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard issues the baseline set of rules that govern mariners.

MSC cannot create policies that alleviate Coast Guard requirements; however, they can make policies that are stricter than Coast Guard rules and requirements.

**Remember:** The Coast Guard is the entity that issues your credential. If you break their rules, or breach their training requirements, they will revoke your credentials.

## Where is Training and Who Offers it?

### MSC Internal Training

Internal training is conducted at MSC's in-house schools:

- **Training Center Hampton Roads** - Williamsburg, Virginia
- **Training Center West** - San Diego, California

These cover essential areas such as Small Arms, MUTC and MSC Supply Courses. Additionally, many internal MSC and Navy trainings can be completed online.

### Outside Entities - Commercial and the Navy

Some classes need to be taken at private maritime training centers. MSC has contracts and programs to facilitate training opportunities at non-MSC owned courses offered by:

- The Navy
- Other government agencies
- Maritime schools
- Commercial vendors

Commonly, CIVMARs will take training at the Maritime Institute at their campus in either Norfolk or San Diego.

### Shipboard Training

On board each vessel, the Chief Mate is designated as the training officer. Each month, the Chief Mate is responsible for providing various trainings to ensure the crew is up to date.

Keep in mind, these trainings will be internal MSC trainings, not STCW trainings.

## Reimbursement Programs

MSC advertises several **Reimbursable Upgrade Programs (RUPs)**. Certain promotions, like OS to AB, 2nd Mate to Chief Mate or Wiper to EU, require classes that are only offered by commercial vendors (like the Maritime Institute), and they can be expensive.

While MSC offers this, the reality can be a bit different for a few reasons:

### 1. Continued Service Commitment

Depending on the class and the cost, MSC may require you to sign a continued service commitment. This rule is consistently changing, so be sure to read any paperwork before signing.

### 2. Manning Shortages May Block Approval

It can be difficult to get approved due to current manning shortage. As mentioned, your MPS may disapprove your training request because they need you in the fleet now and cannot let you go to training for your desired amount.

> Note: Many MPS's will consider training time as leave, and expect you to return to the pool for another assignment directly after training.

### 3. Slow Reimbursement Process

If you are accepted and approved for a reimbursable program, the repayment may take far longer to come than you would hope. It is also important to highlight that it is a **reimbursement**—you will need to pay upfront, and then wait to receive payment after passing the class.

Getting the money will likely be a painful process. Unfortunately, many CIVMARs do not bother with the reimbursement process and pay out of pocket for the trainings due to its poor track record.

**The reimbursement program is a formal process.** If you do not get the class approved ahead of time, there is no chance you will receive reimbursement.

## Realities of Training at MSC

Despite the structured training opportunities, accessing training can be challenging and bureaucratic. Getting scheduled for required trainings can be a very involved and difficult process.

**To have a successful career, CIVMARs need to take initiative and advocate for their own training and career advancement.**

The shoreside apparatus tends to focus more on current needs, rather than long-term professional development. Just because you want to take classes to promote, that does not mean MSC will approve it or pay for it. MSC can, will and does waive training requirements to get people onto ships sooner.

You need to put yourself in a position that makes it easy for MSC to say "yes" to training.

> **At the end of the day, you and you alone are responsible for your career.** With that said, there are ways to reach your desired outcome—it may just be more difficult than you would like.
