As a CIVMAR, you'll be traveling internationally and exploring foreign ports, which is likely a big reason you joined! To use your maps app to find a cool restaurant, post an Instagram picture, or video call your mom to tell her you've arrived safely, you'll need phone connectivity.

Unfortunately, your domestic phone plan won't work outside the United States. Don't worry, though—**eSIMs by Airalo** are cheap, fast, and easy solutions to your overseas connectivity problems.

## eSIM vs. SIM Card

All phones need a SIM card to access mobile data and cellular service.

**SIM Card:** A small physical chip in your phone that identifies your phone to the network and allows you to make calls and access the internet.

**eSIM:** An embedded SIM card, meaning it's built directly into your phone's circuit board. Essentially, it's a digital SIM card. Most new phones now come with eSIMs and no longer have removable physical SIM cards.

---

## How Does It Work?

Before eSIMs, you needed to buy and insert a physical local SIM card into your phone to connect to local networks. If you are a seasoned CIVMAR or traveler, you have probably done this a time or two and know what a hassle it can be.

Now, with Airalo, you can **download an eSIM directly to your phone**, making the process even easier.

## eSIM vs. Roaming: A Price Battle

You might be wondering, "What about an international plan through my phone carrier?"

International phone plans, known as **roaming plans**, allow you to use foreign networks for a fee. However, these fees can get expensive.

| Option | Data | Duration | Price |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Verizon International | 0.5 GB | 1 day | $10.00 |
| Airalo Japan eSIM | 5 GB | 30 days | $11.50 |
| **Airalo with CIVMAR10** | **5 GB** | **30 days** | **$10.35** |

> **For an additional 35 cents, you get 4.5 more gigabytes valid for 29 more days!**

eSIMs by Airalo operate on a prepaid plan, offering more data at a lower cost with no surprise charges.

**Use code CIVMAR10 at checkout for an additional 10% off your purchase.**

## A Quick CIVMAR Example

Say you're assigned to a 7th Fleet (Asia/Far East) T-AKE, like the Washington Chambers, and are scheduled to meet the ship in Japan.

Instead of paying $10 for 0.5 gigabytes of data valid for only one day with Verizon's plan, you could purchase a Japan eSIM with 5 gigabytes of data, valid for 30 days, for $11.50.

With code **CIVMAR10**, that eSIM would be **$10.35**.

## Regional eSIM: AsiaLink

If you're on a 7th Fleet T-AKE, you'll likely visit common ports in the Far East/Asia. If you don't know the common ports, you can look at the "Ports" tab on CIVSail.com for more information.

For the entire 120+ day deployment, you could buy a **regional eSIM like the AsiaLink package**, covering all common 7th Fleet MSC ports and save even more.

Airalo offers:

- **Individual eSIMs** for 200+ countries
- **Regional plans** for all commonly visited MSC Areas of Operation (AORs)

> **Stop overpaying for overseas data and use eSIMs from Airalo!**

## Can My Phone Use eSIMs?

To use eSIMs, your phone needs to be:

1. **Unlocked**
2. **eSIM compatible**

### Is My Phone Unlocked?

A "locked" phone is tied to a specific carrier and cannot use SIM cards from other carriers.

If you're unsure if your phone is unlocked, call your carrier's customer service. **Mention your military orders** (as a CIVMAR, you have them), and most carriers will unlock your phone for free.

### Is My Phone eSIM Compatible?

Most new phones are eSIM compatible. Any iPhone newer than the **iPhone SE (2020)** will work.

For a more expansive list, check Airalo's compatibility page.
