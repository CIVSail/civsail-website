## So Others May Live

Military Sealift Command maintains a Surface Rescue Swimmer Program (SAR or SRSS), ensuring each SAR-capable MSC ship has two U.S. Navy-qualified Surface Rescue Swimmers on board. These swimmers respond to emergency situations such as a man overboard, downed aircraft, or other distress scenarios.

Serving as a SAR swimmer is a collateral duty, meaning it's an additional responsibility alongside your main job. SAR Swimmers receive extra compensation and must complete rigorous training to qualify. Any CIVMAR can try out for the program, but the Surface Rescue Swimmer School has a greater than 50% attrition rate. While the role is demanding and physically challenging, many CIVMARs find it rewarding and are well compensated.

## Training and Timeline

CIVMARs can inquire about the program at any point in their career, but it is recommended to enter the program directly after NEO and before your first ship assignment. If you decide to try out, the typical timeline is as follows:

### Pre-Training

**Location:** Fort Eustis, Virginia

**Length:** Will Vary Based on Candidate Physical Condition

Before attending the official Surface Rescue Swimmer School, SAR candidates train with the SAR Program Manager at Fort Eustis in Virginia. This pre-training involves rigorous exercise in the pool and on land to prepare candidates for the official school. Once deemed physically conditioned by the SAR Program Manager, candidates are scheduled for the official school.

### US Navy Surface Rescue Swimmer School

**Location:** Jacksonville, Florida

**Length:** 4 Weeks

The U.S. Navy Surface Rescue Swimmer School in Jacksonville, Florida is a full-on, high-risk training environment—and as an MSC mariner, you'll be held to the same standard as your Navy counterparts. The course runs for four weeks, Monday through Friday, with no official training on weekends—but make no mistake, you'll be spending your off time studying, practicing, and recovering.

Expect intense PT, challenging in-water evolutions, and a fast-paced academic load covering medical procedures, SAR (Search and Rescue) operations, and survival techniques. You'll be training primarily alongside active-duty Navy personnel, and the class is physically and mentally demanding.

**It is imperative that you show up prepared.**

### Post Training MSC Specific Qualification

**Location:** Norfolk, VA

**Length:** 1-2 weeks

After passing the Surface Rescue Swimmer Course, new SAR Swimmers return to Norfolk, Virginia, for 1-2 weeks of MSC-specific qualification and administrative work. They get qualified by the Afloat Training Group, ensure their personal SAR gear is accounted for, and set up their personal binder. Once complete, they re-enter the pool and await ship assignment.

## Why Do It

### Pay

SAR swimmers receive additional pay while on board and designated as Rescue Swimmers. Here's how it works:

**Overtime and Penalty Rates:**
SAR swimmers are paid overtime at their job-specific rate, while the SAR penalty rate is the same for everyone in the program.

**Overtime and Penalty Pay for Training and Maintenance:**
SAR swimmers are granted a baseline 12 hours of overtime and 12 hours of penalty pay for physical training and gear maintenance. SAR Swimmers get paid to work out!

**Compensation During Flight Quarters:**
When performing SAR duties during flight quarters, swimmers earn Penalty Pay at the MRS rate for the duration of flight quarters. If Flight Quarters are in effect during overtime hours, they earn both Penalty Pay and overtime pay.

**Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP):**
Since November 2022, SAR swimmers receive SDAP (Special Duty Assignment Pay) instead of a yearly bonus. The SDAP pay is like a retention pay for SAR Swimmers. SDAP provides 2.5 hours of the MRS penalty pay rate for each day on board.

> Unique to SRS pay, **pyramiding is allowed**. Pyramiding allows SAR swimmers to earn two different pay rates for the same hour of work. For instance, if flight quarters occur during overtime hours, you are paid both the overtime rate and the Penalty/MRS rate. Typically, CIVMARs receive the higher of the two rates, but SAR swimmers are entitled to both.

### Compensation Breakdown Per Pay Period

**Physical Training:**

- 10 hours of overtime (paid at your job-specific rate)
- 10 hours of MRS penalty pay (paid at the MRS rate)

**Gear Maintenance:**

- 2 hours of overtime (paid at your job-specific rate)
- 2 hours of MRS penalty pay (paid at the MRS rate)

**Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP):**

- 35 hours of penalty pay (paid at the MRS rate)

**Operational Compensation:**

- Extra overtime and Penalty Pay as dictated by flight operations and real-world events

### A Sense of Duty - So Others May Live

Financial incentives are attractive, but candidates need more motivation to enter and pass the training. The job involves daunting responsibilities, and the Navy Instructors enforce high standards. The Rescue Swimmer motto "So Others May Live" embodies the dedication required. Over 50% of students fail SAR school, so it's crucial to have a strong reason for joining beyond the pay.

## Physical Standards

On day 1 of Surface Rescue Swimmer School a Physical Standards Test (PST) is administered. If a candidate does not pass the PST, they are dropped from the school.

### Minimum Standards

| Exercise       | Requirement                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Pull-Ups       | 4 repetitions in 2 minutes    |
| Sit-Ups        | 50 repetitions in 2 minutes   |
| Push-Ups       | 42 repetitions in 2 minutes   |
| 1.5 Mile Run   | Completed in under 12 minutes |
| 500 Meter Swim | Completed in under 12 minutes |

### Competitive Standards

To be competitive, strive to exceed these standards:

| Exercise       | Target                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pull-Ups       | 10+ repetitions in 2 minutes    |
| Sit-Ups        | 80+ repetitions in 2 minutes    |
| Push-Ups       | 80+ repetitions in 2 minutes    |
| 1.5 Mile Run   | Completed in under 9:30 minutes |
| 400 Meter Swim | Completed in under 8 minutes    |

Pre-Training ensures MSC SAR candidates are in the best physical condition prior to going to the school.

## Common Questions

### Does this Change How I am Relieved?

Yes. As a SAR Swimmer, you hold two positions: your specific job billet and the SAR billet. Two people are needed to relieve you, or another SAR-qualified person of the same rate. Helicopter-equipped operational ships typically require two SAR Swimmers, but there are instructions that allow ships to reduce to one swimmer depending on their operational status. For example, ships may operate with only one SAR Swimmer before entering a shipyard or maintenance period.

### Does being a SRS Swimmer Limit Me to Certain Vessels?

Yes. Due to the limited number of SAR Swimmers, you will only be assigned to SAR-equipped vessels, which include:

- T-AKE
- T-AOE
- T-AH
- T-AS
- LCC

### Can I Leave the SAR Program?

Yes. There is no specified commitment to stay in the program, and people leave for various reasons.

## The SAR Program: A Unique Opportunity

The Surface Rescue Swimmer Program (SAR or SRS) offers CIVMARs a unique and challenging opportunity to serve in a vital and rewarding role. While the training is rigorous and the demands are high, the financial incentives and the profound sense of duty make it worthwhile for many.

SAR Swimmers are important members of the fleet and respond to emergencies with skill and dedication. Whether drawn by the call to help others or the attractive compensation, candidates must prepare thoroughly and maintain a strong commitment to succeed.

For those who meet the challenge, the program offers both professional growth and the honor of upholding the life-saving mission embodied in the motto, **"So Others May Live."**
