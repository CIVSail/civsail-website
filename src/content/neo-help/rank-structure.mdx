Like the military, Military Sealift Command (MSC) has a rank structure to organize its personnel. This structure is divided into different jobs, called "rates."

There are officers, chief petty officers (CPOs), and non-officer positions, similar to the military. However, in the maritime industry, we have:

- **Licensed Officers** - Like commissioned officers in the military. They either attended a maritime academy or worked their way up through the ranks to earn a deck or engineering license.
- **Staff Officers** - Also officers, but they don't have a license.
- **Chief Petty Officers** - Like non-commissioned officers in the military. They don't have a license, but they are experienced leaders.
- **Unlicensed CIVMARs** - Like enlisted members in the military.

In this article, we'll explain where each rank fits in the shipboard hierarchy and what you need to do to move up to each position!

## Important Notes, Concepts and Definitions

### Merchant Mariner Credentials (MMC)

A Merchant Mariner Credential is a document issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) that lists your qualifications for specific jobs on ships you can legally perform. When people talk about "licenses" or "endorsements," they're referring to certifications on your MMC.

### Credible Sea Days vs. MSC Experience

**Credible Sea Days** are an official metric that tracks the days you spend on a ship doing tasks that help you become better at your job. Credible Sea Days have various rules, regulations and scenarios dictated by the Coast Guard. Sea Days are tracked via an official document called a Sea Service Letter.

**MSC experience**, on the other hand, is just time working for MSC. For promotions, you might need both credible sea days and MSC experience.

### License Upgrades and Promotions

> **Important:** Getting a more advanced license from the Coast Guard doesn't automatically mean you'll get promoted at MSC. It only means you are qualified for promotion.

To be permanently promoted, you'll need to apply and be selected for promotion as dictated by MSC. It is possible to be credentialed above your current position.

For example, many Third Mates have their Second Mates licenses, but they are still sailing as and being paid as a Third Mate. However, they are eligible to be promoted to Second Mate because they hold the requisite license.

### Departments on MSC Vessels

There are four main departments on MSC ships:

1. **Deck**
2. **Engine**
3. **Supply** (which has Supply and Steward branches)
4. **Communications**

While all CIVMARs need an MMC, only Deck and Engine departments require sea days and additional Coast Guard regulated trainings for promotions.

## Deck Department

**Ordinary Seaman (OS):** Entry level position. If you have a Merchant Mariner Credential, you are qualified to be an OS.

**Able-Bodied Seaman (AB):** To upgrade from OS to AB, several Coast Guard classes are required as well as enough credible sea days. OS to AB will entail additional endorsements on your MMC.

**Boatswain Mate (BM):** BMs require the same MMC endorsements as ABs, but they need MSC experience to be promoted from AB to BM.

**Boatswain (BOSN):** A Deck Department Chief Petty Officer position. The boatswain is the direct supervisor of the maintenance working ABs and OSs. MSC classes and experience is needed to promote to BOSN from BM. You typically need to sail in the BM position prior to promotion but it is not required.

**Operations Chief (OPS):** A Chief Petty Officer that assists the navigator with coordinating the vessel's operational schedule. Prior Navy experience or specific classes are required to promote to OPS Chief.

**3rd Mate (3/O or 3/M):** The most junior licensed deck officer. 3/Ms are the direct supervisor of watch standing ABs. 3/Ms must have a 3rd Officer Coast Guard license.

## Final Thoughts

While MSC is distinctly different from the military in a lot of ways, you can still be outranked, and you do have a boss. MSC retains a chain of command, and it needs to be respected.

MSC's rank structure is flatter than the military's and does not have the same rules of decorum (i.e., you don't have to salute the Captain when you see him), but it is important to remember that he is still your boss.

> **Word to the wise:** You will generally have better luck if you respect your supervisor and other shipboard leaders.

If you still have questions about how promotions work within MSC, Coast Guard licensing or about positions within MSC, that is A-OK—MSC is confusing and full of bureaucratic twists, turns and black holes.
